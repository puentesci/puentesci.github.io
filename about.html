          <h3>Founded in 2025</h3>
          <p>Puente Scientific was established with a clear vision: to bridge the gap between cutting-edge scientific equipment and emerging markets worldwide. Based in Hoover, Alabama, we recognized the growing need for cost-effective, high-quality laboratory equipment in developing regions.</p>

          <h3>Our Mission</h3>
          <p>We specialize in refurbishing and reselling HPLC equipment, sourcing hard-to-find parts, and connecting suppliers with global markets. Our mission is to expand worldwide access to essential lab technology through cost-effective, refurbished solutions.</p>

          <h3>Why We Started</h3>
          <p>Seeing the 45% growth in emerging tech markets and recognizing that laboratories could save up to 85% with refurbished equipment, we knew there was an opportunity to make a meaningful impact. We believe that scientific advancement shouldn't be limited by budget constraints.</p>

          <h3>Global Impact</h3>
          <p>We envision a world where every laboratory, regardless of location or budget, has access to the equipment they need to advance scientific research and discovery. Our goal is to be the bridge that connects surplus equipment with laboratories that need it most.</p>

          <h3>Sustainable Solutions</h3>
          <p>By giving used equipment a second life abroad, we're not just saving money for our clientsâ€”we're contributing to a more sustainable approach to scientific equipment lifecycle management. Every refurbished piece of equipment reduces waste and environmental impact.</p>

          <h3>Innovation Through Accessibility</h3>
          <p>We believe that innovation thrives when barriers are removed. By making high-quality equipment accessible to emerging markets, we're helping to democratize scientific research and development worldwide.</p>
